# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected using machine learning techniques. 
The system is trained on historical loan data and deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## Dataset
Loan Approval Prediction Dataset from Kaggle
